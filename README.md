## Algorithm

    - Allows us to use data structures to perform actions on that data.
    - Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
    - Class{} + function() = Program
    - for doing majority of scaling to improve our programs.
    - Can reduce time complexity, space complexity.

# Recursion

    - Isn't technically algorithms.
    - More of a concept.
    - Used a lot using in another algorithms.
    - such as "ls -R"  -R:recursive
    - When you define something in terms of itself. It's a function that refers to itself inside of the function.

    - How recursion helps us solve problems
    - Recursion is good for tasks that have repeated subtasks to do.
    - used in searching and sorting.
